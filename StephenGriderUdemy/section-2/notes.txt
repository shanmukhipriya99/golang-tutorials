GO CLI

- go build => compiles a source of go source code files
- go run => compiles & executes one or two files
- go fmt => formats all the code in each file in the current directory
- go install => compiles & "installs" a package
- go get => downloads the raw source code of someone else's package
- go test => runs any tests associated with the current project

Types of Packages:

- Executable => generates a file that we can run
- Reusable => code used as "helpers", good place to put reusable logic

A package named "main" is always Executable
and it should always have the function main

A package with any other name is a Reusable package
