We can initialize a variable outside of a function, we just can't assign a value to it.

:= should be used only while initializing a new variable
= for assigning value to an initialized variable

- Array: fixed length of things
- Slice: an array that can grow or shrink

Array and Slice should have the same data type values

Slice range:
    fruits[startIndexIncluding : upToNotIncluding]
    fruits[:2] => from first element
    fruits[2:] => from 2nd element to the end
